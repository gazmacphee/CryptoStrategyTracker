# Project Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified Project Architecture**
   - Replaced complex dependency injection system with simpler direct imports
   - Fixed timestamp parsing in Binance data files by forcing explicit int64 dtypes
   - Implemented a simpler reset_and_start.py script that works reliably

2. **Project Organization**
   - Created `legacy_archive` folder for obsolete files
   - Organized ML modules into `legacy_archive/ml_modules` 
   - Archived the complex `src` directory structure with dependency injection
   - Created a cleaner directory structure in `clean_structure/`

3. **Archived Files**
   - Moved rarely used utility scripts to archive (gap_filler.py, unprocessed_files.py, etc.)
   - Archived documentation that's no longer relevant (project_architecture.md, app_startup_flow.md)
   - Stored ML modules that aren't actively used in the simplified implementation
   - Kept backup of sentiment analysis and news functionality

## Legacy Archive

The `legacy_archive` directory contains:

1. **Original Modular Architecture**
   - Complete `src/` directory with dependency injection pattern
   - Service-oriented architecture with repositories

2. **ML Modules**
   - Model ensemble system
   - Market regime detection
   - Sentiment analysis integration
   - Backtesting dashboard
   - Trading strategy generator

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Crypto news integration
   - Sentiment scraping
   - Gap filling functionality
   - Specialized data processing scripts

## Next Steps

1. Review the `clean_structure` directory to ensure it works as expected
2. Delete unnecessary files from the main directory after confirming the clean structure works
3. If needed, specific modules from the legacy archive can be reintegrated in a simpler way
